Scripts (in Autohotkey) to help with completing Wordament, Jumble and Crossword puzzles

# Jumble
Open up your browser, go to https://www.wordplays.com/word-jumble-solver/and open it up on the right side of your monitor. 
In your Jumble game, put it on the left side of the screen.
After the game has loaded, press Ctrl-B to enter the characters in the character row.
The cursor will be taken to the website and the characters will write themselves.
After that, you have to manually move the cursor to hit 'Download Answers'.
After that, the script will automatically write all keywords in game.

# Crossword
This is the most hands-free script of the lot.
Simply press Ctrl-B and the crossword will be completed in about a minute.
One caveat is that the game needs to be in a smaller than 50% split on the left side because I'm too lazy to fix it. :)

# Wordament
To be honest, this is easily the worst script of the lot.
Go to https://www.dcode.fr/wordament-solver and open it on the right side of screen, similar to the Jumble puzzle.
In your Wordament game, make note of the style of the puzzle.
Sometimes it's a prefix (pre-, de-, etc.), sometimes its a suffix (-less, -ed, etc.) and sometimes it might be an either/or.
Press Ctrl-B to start the script, enter the characters in left to right, top to bottom order.
If a square has multiple characters in it, just write the first character.
For example, if it is 'PRE-', just write 'P'.
There should only be 16 characters in the text box.
After entering, wait for the cursor to fill in the box for you.
Make sure to make amendments for the longer character boxes (like the 'PRE-' example).
Select the correct variation (Either/Or, Digram, etc.).
Then press enter, and it will run script.
